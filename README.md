For this to work, for CORS (**C**ross-**O**rigin-**R**esouce-**S**haring) reasons, you need to run the **music** project in a Chrome browser that has CORS disabled. **THIS ALSO APPLIES TO THE WEBSITE LINK ATTACHED TO THIS REPOSITORY**  
  
This can be achieved through executing the following command: `chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security`  
For more information, and better ways to handle CORS issues see [Access-Control-Allow-Origin Error](https://daveceddia.com/access-control-allow-origin-cors-errors-in-angular/).
